# Offline Support Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the offline support features implemented in the AI Chatbot application. The implementation uses Dexie.js for client-side storage and provides a seamless experience for users when they lose internet connectivity.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Local Storage with Dexie.js

- **Database Setup**: Implemented a client-side database using Dexie.js to store chats, messages, and documents locally.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Created a fallback system using `fake-indexeddb` for environments where native IndexedDB is not available.
- **Initialization Detection**: Added functionality to detect when the database is properly initialized and ready for use.

### 2. Network Status Detection

- **Online/Offline Detection**: Implemented real-time detection of network status changes.
- **User Notifications**: Added UI components to inform users when they're offline and that their data will be saved locally.
- **Sync Status Indicator**: Created a component to show the current synchronization status and allow manual syncing.

### 3. Data Synchronization

- **Bidirectional Sync**: Implemented synchronization of data between the local database and the server.
- **Dirty Record Tracking**: Added tracking of modified records that need to be synchronized with the server.
- **Automatic Sync**: Set up automatic synchronization when the application comes back online.
- **Manual Sync**: Added the ability for users to manually trigger synchronization.

### 4. Chat Offline Support

- **Local Chat Storage**: Implemented storage of chat data in the local database.
- **Offline Chat Creation**: Added the ability to create new chats while offline.
- **Offline Message Addition**: Enabled adding messages to chats while offline.
- **Chat Fallback Component**: Created a component to display chats from local storage when they can't be retrieved from the server.

### 5. Document Offline Support

- **Local Document Storage**: Implemented storage of documents in the local database.
- **Offline Document Creation**: Added the ability to create and edit documents while offline.
- **Document Fallback Component**: Created a component to display documents from local storage when they can't be retrieved from the server.
- **Automatic Document Saving**: Implemented automatic saving of documents to local storage when they're modified.

### 6. Testing Tools

- **Offline Simulation**: Created a test page with tools to simulate offline status for testing.
- **Document Test Component**: Implemented a component to test document creation and retrieval in offline mode.
- **Test Documentation**: Added comprehensive instructions for testing offline functionality.

## Technical Implementation

### LocalStorageContext

The `LocalStorageContext` provides a central point for managing all offline functionality:

- **Initialization**: Handles database initialization and fallback.
- **Network Status**: Tracks online/offline status.
- **Sync Management**: Manages synchronization of data with the server.
- **Data Operations**: Provides methods for CRUD operations on chats, messages, and documents.

### Database Structure

The client-side database includes the following tables:

- **chats**: Stores chat metadata (title, creation date, etc.)
- **messages**: Stores chat messages with references to their parent chats
- **documents**: Stores document data (title, content, kind, etc.)

Each record includes fields for tracking synchronization status:
- `syncedAt`: Timestamp of the last successful sync
- `isDirty`: Flag indicating whether the record needs to be synced

### Synchronization Process

The synchronization process includes:

1. **Initialization**: Starting the sync process when the application loads
2. **Periodic Sync**: Automatically attempting to sync at regular intervals
3. **Push Changes**: Sending local changes to the server when online
4. **Pull Changes**: Retrieving server changes and updating local data
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Simple "last write wins" strategy for conflicts

## Usage

### For Users

Users don't need to take any special actions to use the offline functionality:

- When offline, they can continue using the application as normal
- A notification will inform them when they're offline
- Changes will be automatically saved locally
- When they come back online, changes will be synchronized with the server
- A sync status indicator shows the current synchronization status

### For Developers

Developers can use the `LocalStorageContext` to interact with the offline functionality:

```typescript
const { 
  isInitialized,
  isOnline,
  hasPendingChanges,
  syncNow,
  // Chat methods
  getChats,
  getChat,
  getChatMessages,
  saveChat,
  saveMessage,
  // Document methods
  getDocument,
  getDocuments,
  saveDocument,
  // ... other methods
} = useLocalStorageContext();
```

## Testing

A dedicated test page is available at `/test-offline` for testing offline functionality:

1. Create test documents while online
2. Simulate going offline
3. Create and retrieve documents while offline
4. Restore online status
5. Verify that changes are synchronized

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements to the offline support:

1. **Better Conflict Resolution**: Implement more sophisticated conflict resolution strategies
2. **Sync Queue Management**: Add the ability to prioritize certain types of data for synchronization
3. **Selective Sync**: Allow users to choose what data to synchronize
4. **Background Sync**: Implement background synchronization using Service Workers
5. **Offline Analytics**: Track and analyze offline usage patterns
